# Data Structures implemented in C++

This is a very very very basic project I did to be more familiar with C++ (especially pointers and oop). The project includes implementation of Stack, Queue, and LinkedList in a very basic way, with just add() and traverse() methods (some classes such as Stack and Queue have 1 more function).

The build files of this project is generated by CMake, so if you want to run it, make sure you have installed `make` and `cmake`. To run the project, simply cd into `builds` folder, then type:

```
cmake ..
make
./DataStructures
```

As you can see, the executable is generated inside the `builds` folder.

Thanks for being interested in, I'll probably add more functionality to the classes soon.
